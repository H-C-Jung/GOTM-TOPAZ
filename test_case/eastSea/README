These simulations are made for the location of station 271 Central Eastern
Gotland Sea of the Baltic Sea at 20 deg E and 57.3 deg N with a water depth 
of 250 m. Initial conditions for temperature and salinity are derived from 
measurements. Meteorological forcing was available from the ERA15 reanalysis 
data set (http://wms.ecmwf.int/research/era/Era-15.html).
For the penetration of solar radiation into the water column, fairly 
turbid water (Jerlov type IB) is assumed. Salinity concentrations are nudged 
to observations with a time scale of 2 days.

The simulation is carried out for the years 1980-1990.
For the discretisation, the water column has been
divided into 100 vertical layers, with a strong zooming towards the surface,
resulting in a mean near-surface resolution of less than 0.5 m.
The time step for these simulations is set to 10 minutes.
